# Lunar
Lunar is a neural network aim assist that uses real-time object detection accelerated with CUDA on Nvidia GPUs.

## About

Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Lunar is that it does meddle with the memory of other processes.

The basis of Lunar's player detection is the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) architecture written in PyTorch.

A demo video (outdated) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDAcQNUuT84).

## Installation

1. Install a version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or later.

2. Navigate to the root directory. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```           
python lunar.py
```
To update sensitivity settings:
```           
python lunar.py setup
```
To collect image data for annotating and training:
```           
python lunar.py collect_data
```


## Issues
- The method of mouse movement ([SendInput](https://github.com/zeyad-mansour/Lunar/blob/45e05373036f8bd072667313c155e55735cd7f57/lib/aimbot.py#L126)) is slow. For this reason, the crosshair often lags behind a moving detection. This problem can be lessened by increasing the [pixel_increment](https://github.com/zeyad-mansour/Lunar/blob/45e05373036f8bd072667313c155e55735cd7f57/lib/aimbot.py#L56) (e.g. to 4) so fewer calls to that function are made.
- False positives can also happen under certain lighting conditions.
